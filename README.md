Project members : Annapoorna A, Lavanya R Gejji, Chethana M, Dhanush H A

Real time sorting data are useful in the cutting edge applications where the data has to be retrieved very faster.
We are trying to build a architecture that focuses on real time data sorting using FPGA.
FPGA's are well known for their parallelism and faster speed, using FPGA we can acheive the real time data sorting very efficiently.
